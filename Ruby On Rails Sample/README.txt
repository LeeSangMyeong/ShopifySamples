Sample (and first attempt at) ruby on rails without heroku. Made from chapters 2-4 of the turorial page:
http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book

All tables created using 'rails generate scaffold <Table_Name> <first_field>:<type> <second_field>:<type>'
Data Models updated using the 'bundle exec rake db:migrate' command.
Build and install using 'bundle install'

Very simple. This is mostly setting up data views to make sure that I could do it.

When built and run the users are accessable from http://localhost:3000/users
When built and run the microposts are accessable from http://localhost:300/microposts

Modified the users page from the demo to show the ID from the database because I wanted to see it
Modified the microposts page from the demo to show the ID from the database because I wanted to see it

Done using the railsinstaller setup on windows.

Still learning Ruby on Rails and would love to continue.
